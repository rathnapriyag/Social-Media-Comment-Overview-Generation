# Social-Media-Comment-Overview-Generation

Our proposed model will provide a way for the influencers to get a gist of these comments. The model works by scanning through multiple comments for a particular content and generates a summarized paragraph which gives an overview of the comments. This overview will be helpful for both the influencers and the viewers, as influencers can see how their content was received and the viewers can get to know what to expect from the content based on previous viewersâ€™ experience.
